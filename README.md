README

Repository contains code for our (Jingtian Chen, Srinidhi Narayanan, Anahita Srinivasan) NLP (MIT 6.8610) final project, which proposes novel methods for legal passage retrieval. Key to the project is the LePaRD dataset, which contains millions of example quotes (context) from court cases along with the cited precedent case and particular quote within. We use a cut of the data (top 10k examples) which can be found here (omitted from repo due to size constraints): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A02rma5-s_M4UOn7IklAXz6CtpHwoh-g/view?usp=drive_link.
