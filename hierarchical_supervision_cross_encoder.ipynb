She is limited to occasional postural activities but should do no climbing of ladders, ropes or scaffolds; must avoid concentrated exposure to extreme cold and vibration; and handling, fingering and fingering [sic] are limited to frequently as opposed to constantly.\\n6. The claimant is capable of performing past relevant work as a secretary. This work does not require the performance of work-related activities precluded by the claimant\\u2019s residual functional capacity.\\n7. The claimant has not been under a disability, as defined in the Social Security Act, from February 13, 2012, through the date of this decision.\\n(Tr. at 24-30)\\nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\\nFindings of fact made by the ALJ, as adopted by the Appeals Council, are conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence. See 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3) (2015). Judicial review of the ALJ\\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether \\u201csubstantial evidence\\u201d supports the decision. See Monsour Med. Ctr. v. Heckler, 806 F.2d 1185, 1190 (3d Cir. 1986). In making this determination, a reviewing court may not undertake a de novo review of the ALJ\\u2019s decision and may not re-weigh the evidence of record. See id. In other words, even if the reviewing court would have decided the case differently, the court must affirm the ALJ\\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence. See id. at 1190-91.\\nSubstantial evidence is defined as less than a preponderance of the evidence, but more than a mere scintilla of evidence. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, substantial evidence \\u201c\",\n          \"\\nIn the present case, nude dancing has not been prohibited. Rather, a four-foot buffer zone has been mandated for the purpose of preventing drug transactions and solicitations for prostitution from taking place, both of which will be significantly less likely if entertainers and patrons maintain their distance from one another. The question, therefore, is whether the Municipality has sustained its \\u201csubstantial burden\\u201d of establishing that the impairment of Plaintiffs rights is justified by a \\u201ccompelling governmental interest.\\u201d As discussed in the previous section, Federal caselaw has found that a government\\u2019s interest in curbing the secondary effects as sociated with adult entertainment establishments is substantial, and this Court finds that such a substantial interest is the equivalent of a \\u201ccompelling interest\\u201d under the Alaska analysis.\\nEqual Protection\\nParagraph 43(n) of the complaint alleges that AMC 10.40.050 violates the equal protection doctrine under the United States and Alaska constitutions. Plaintiff complains that the ordinance seeks to impose regulations on its business which are greater than those imposed upon alcoholic serving establishments offering the identical type of entertainment as the Plaintiff.\\n\\u2014Federal Analysis\\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no State shall \\u201c\",\n          \" Mr. Diaz, Adjuster, IHDS Tallahassee, replied to Mr. Bor\\u2019s letter and stated that he will be handling Ms. Vale\\u2019s claim and to direct all correspondence to him. (Docket No. 14). Afterwards, Mr. Bor sent Mr. Diaz a letter, dated June 15, 1998, which included a narrative of the incident, a demand for medical expenses and a demand for pain and suffering settlement. (Docket No. 14).\\nUnable to reach a settlement, Plaintiff filed suit against K-Mart in the Superior Court of New Jersey on January 20, 1999. (Docket No. 11). This action was dismissed based on forum non conveniens, through Order dated September 27, 1999. (Docket No. 1 at 38). Plaintiff filed suit against K-Mart and IHDS Tallahassee in this Court on September 15, 2000. (Docket No. I).\\nDISCUSSION\\nI. K-Mart\\u2019s Motion to Dismiss\\nK-Mart argues that according to the statutory time limitation of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico the complaint filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey was time barred. (Docket No. 5). In K-Mart\\u2019s reply to plaintiffs opposition to motion to dismiss, K-Mart argues that the letters sent by plaintiffs former legal representation, Mr. Bor, were addressed to IHDS Tallahassee, which is an independent adjusting company, and as such, do not have the effect of tolling the prescription period. (Docket No. 10 at 4).\\nA. Motion to Dismiss Standard.\\nPursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint may not be dismissed unless it appears beyond doubt that plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. See Brown v. Hot, Sexy, and Safer Prods., Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 530 (1st Cir.1995). The Court accepts all well-pleaded factual allegations as true, and draws all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.
